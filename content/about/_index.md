### Welcome to The Nest, my little obscure corner of the internet

## About Me

My name is Crow and my primary work is in the devops field with some security
advising on the side. I'm a huge fan of selfhosting and that's primarily why I
started this site. The intent of this site is honestly just for me to have a
place to log what I'm working on across my various hobbies. If you find
something useful on this site, then that's just an added bonus.

If you want to reach out, feel free to contact me via email:
